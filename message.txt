1-Fixing the arabic encodign bug by using UTF-8 in config.cfg file 

2-create kill_process function to kill the process on port 9222 after quiting driver

3.fix the bug of suspension after "starting chrome session" line and after "starting edge session" line

the susspension was due to start_session functions weren't able to launch a new chrome.exe and msedge.exe proceses

so we fixed the bug by creating a subprocess (modifying the start_session functions)

4.The first beta release to be published as exe program for windwos
